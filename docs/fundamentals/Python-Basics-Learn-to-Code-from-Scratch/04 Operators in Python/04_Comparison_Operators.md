## Comparison Operators


Comparison operators are used to compare values or expressions in Python, and they always return a Boolean value (True or False) depending on the result of the comparison.

Here are the comparison operators in Python:

* Equal to (==): This operator checks if the left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side.

* Not equal to (!=): This operator checks if the left-hand side is not equal to the right-hand side.

* Greater than (>): This operator checks if the left-hand side is greater than the right-hand side.

* Less than (<): This operator checks if the left-hand side is less than the right-hand side.

* Greater than or equal to (>=): This operator checks if the left-hand side is greater than or equal to the right-hand side.

* Less than or equal to (<=): This operator checks if the left-hand side is less than or equal to the right-hand side.


### Equal to (==)

```python
a = 15
b = 10
print(a==b)
```

### Not equal to (!=)

```python
print(a!=b)
```

### Greater than (>)

```python
print(a>b)
```

### Less than (<)

```python
print(a<b)
```

### Greater than or equal to (>=)

```python
print(a>=b)
```

### Less than or equal to (>=)

```python
print(a<=b)
```
