## Arithmetic Operators


Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations on numeric data types in Python. There are several arithmetic operators available in Python, which are listed below:

* Addition (+): The addition operator is used to add two or more numbers or concatenate two or more strings.

* Subtraction (-): The subtraction operator is used to subtract one number from another.

* Multiplication (*): The multiplication operator is used to multiply two or more numbers.

* Division (/): The division operator is used to divide one number by another. It always returns a float value, even if the division result is an integer.

* Floor Division (//): The floor division operator is used to divide one number by another and return the integer quotient. It rounds down to the nearest whole number.

* Modulus (%): The modulus operator is used to find the remainder of the division operation.

* Exponentiation (**): The exponentiation operator is used to raise a number to a power.


### Addition (+)

```python
# Addition of two numbers
a = 10
b = 15 
add = a + b
print(add)
```

### Subtraction (-)

```python
# Subtraction of two numbers
a = 20
b = 10
sub = a - b
print(sub)
```

### Multiplication (*)

```python
# Multiplication of two numbers
a = 3
b = 5
mul = a * b
print(mul)
```

### Division (/)

```python
# Division of two numbers
a = 15
b = 4
div = a / b
print(div)
```

### Floor Division (//)

```python
# Floor division of two numbers
a = 15
b = 4
fdiv = a // b
print(fdiv)
```

### Modulus (%)

```python
# Remainder of division operation
a = 15
b = 4
mod = a % b
print(mod)
```

### Exponentiation (**)

```python
# Power of a number
a = 4
b = 2
exp = a ** b
print(exp)
```
