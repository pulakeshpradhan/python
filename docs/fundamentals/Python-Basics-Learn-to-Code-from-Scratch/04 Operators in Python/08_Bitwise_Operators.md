## Bitwise Operators


Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on the binary representation of integer values. In Python, the following bitwise operators are available:

* & (Bitwise AND): This operator performs a bitwise AND operation on the binary representation of two integers.

* | (Bitwise OR): This operator performs a bitwise OR operation on the binary representation of two integers.

* ^ (Bitwise XOR): This operator performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation on the binary representation of two integers.

* ~ (Bitwise NOT): This operator performs a bitwise NOT operation on the binary representation of an integer, which flips all the bits.

* << (Bitwise left shift): This operator shifts the bits of an integer to the left by a specified number of positions.

*  (Bitwise right shift) >>: This operator shifts the bits of an integer to the right by a specified number of positions.


### & (Bitwise AND)

```python
a = 20
b = 8
print(a & b)
```

### | (Bitwise OR)

```python
print(a | b)
```

### ^ (Bitwise XOR)

```python
print(a ^ b)
```

### ~ (Bitwise NOT)

```python
print(~a)
```

### << (Bitwise left shift)

```python
print(a << 2)
```

### >> (Bitwise right shift)

```python
print(a >> 2)
```
