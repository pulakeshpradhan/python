## Logical Operators


Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions in Python. They always return a Boolean value (True or False) depending on the result of the logical operation.

Here are the logical operators in Python:

* and: This operator returns True if both conditions are True.

* or: This operator returns True if at least one of the conditions is True.

* not: This operator returns the opposite Boolean value of the condition.


### and

```python
x = True
y = False
print(x and y)
```

### or

```python
print(x or y)
```

### not

```python
print(not x)
print(not y)
```
