## Assignment Operators


Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables in Python. They are a shorthand way of performing arithmetic or bitwise operations and then assigning the result to a variable.

There are several types of assignment operators available in Python, which are listed below:

* Simple assignment (=): The simple assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable.

* Addition assignment (+=): The addition assignment operator adds a value to a variable and then assigns the result to the same variable.

* Subtraction assignment (-=): The subtraction assignment operator subtracts a value from a variable and then assigns the result to the same variable.

* Multiplication assignment (*=): The multiplication assignment operator multiplies a variable by a value and then assigns the result to the same variable.

* Division assignment (/=): The division assignment operator divides a variable by a value and then assigns the result to the same variable.

* Modulus assignment (%=): The modulus assignment operator finds the remainder of dividing a variable by a value and then assigns the result to the same variable.

* Exponentiation assignment (**=): The exponentiation assignment operator raises a variable to a power and then assigns the result to the same variable.


### Simple Assignment (=)

```python
a = 5
```

### Addition Assignment (+=)

```python
a += 5
print(a)
```

### Subtraction Assignment (-=)

```python
a -= 5
print(a)
```

### Multiplication Assignment (*=)

```python
a *= 5
print(a)
```

### Division Assignment (/=)

```python
a /= 5
print(a)
```

### Modulus Assignment (%=)

```python
a %= 2
print(a)
```

### Exponentiation Assignment (**=)

```python
b = 4
b **= 2
print(b)
```
