# Python Exercise (31-40)


## Question 31

>***Define a function which can print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys.***



```python

```

## Question 32

>***Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys. The function should just print the keys only.***

```python

```

## Question 33

>***Define a function which can generate and print a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).***


```python

```

## Question 34

>***Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to print the first 5 elements in the list.***

```python

```

## Question 35

>***Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to print the last 5 elements in the list.***

```python

```

## Question 36

>***Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to print all values except the first 5 elements in the list.***

```python

```

## Question 37
>***Define a function which can generate and print a tuple where the value are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).***

```python

```

## Question 38
>***With a given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), write a program to print the first half values in one line and the last half values in one line.***

```python

```

## Question 39
>***Write a program to generate and print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).***

```python

```

## Question 40

>***Write a program which accepts a string as input to print "Yes" if the string is "yes" or "YES" or "Yes", otherwise print "No".***


```python

```
