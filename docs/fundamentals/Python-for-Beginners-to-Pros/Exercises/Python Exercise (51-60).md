# Python Exercise (51-60)


## Question 51
> ***Write a function to compute 5/0 and use try/except to catch the exceptions.***


```python

```

## Question 52
> ***Define a custom exception class which takes a string message as attribute.***

```python

```

## Question 53
> ***Assuming that we have some email addresses in the "username@companyname.com" format, please write program to print the user name of a given email address. Both user names and company names are composed of letters only.***

> ***Example:
If the following email address is given as input to the 
program:***
```
john@google.com
```
> ***Then, the output of the program should be:***
```
john
```
> ***In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.***

```python

```

## Question 54

> ***Assuming that we have some email addresses in the "username@companyname.com" format, please write program to print the company name of a given email address. Both user names and company names are composed of letters only.***

> ***Example:
If the following email address is given as input to the program:***
```
john@google.com
```
> ***Then, the output of the program should be:***
```
google
```
> ***In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.***

### Hints 
> ***Use \w to match letters.***

```python

```

## Question 55
>***Write a program which accepts a sequence of words separated by whitespace as input to print the words composed of digits only.***

>***Example:
If the following words is given as input to the program:***
```
2 cats and 3 dogs.
```
>***Then, the output of the program should be:***
```
['2', '3']
```
>***In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.***

```python

```

## Question 56
> ***Print a unicode string "hello world".***


```python

```

<!-- #region -->
## Question 57
> ***Write a program to read an ASCII string and to convert it to a unicode string encoded by utf-8.***


### Hints 
> ***Use unicode()/encode() function to convert.***
<!-- #endregion -->

```python

```

## Question 58
> ***Write a special comment to indicate a Python source code file is in unicode.***



```python

```

## Question 59
>***Write a program to compute 1/2+2/3+3/4+...+n/n+1 with a given n input by console (n>0).***

>***Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:***
```
5
```
>***Then, the output of the program should be:***
```
3.55
```
>***In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.***



```python

```

## Question 60

>***Write a program to compute:***
```
f(n)=f(n-1)+100 when n>0
and f(0)=1
```
>***with a given n input by console (n>0).***

>***Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:***
```
5
```
>***Then, the output of the program should be:***
```
500
```
>***In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.***



> Solution 1
