# Python Exercise (81-90)


# Question 81
>***By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing numbers which are divisible by 5 and 7 in [12,24,35,70,88,120,155].***

```python

```

## Question 82
>***By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing the 0th, 2nd, 4th,6th numbers in [12,24,35,70,88,120,155].***


```python

```

<!-- #region -->
## Question 83

>***By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing the 2nd - 4th numbers in [12,24,35,70,88,120,155].***


> ***Use list comprehension to delete a bunch of element from a list.
Use enumerate() to get (index, value) tuple.***
<!-- #endregion -->

```python

```

## Question 84

> ***By using list comprehension, please write a program generate a 3\*5\*8 3D array whose each element is 0.***


```python

```

## Question 85
>***By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing the 0th,4th,5th numbers in [12,24,35,70,88,120,155].***


```python

```

## Question 86
>***By using list comprehension, please write a program to print the list after removing the value 24 in [12,24,35,24,88,120,155].***

----------------------
### Hints 
> ***Use list's remove method to delete a value.***



```python

```

## Question 87

>***With two given lists [1,3,6,78,35,55] and [12,24,35,24,88,120,155], write a program to make a list whose elements are intersection of the above given lists.***

----------------------
### Hints 
>***Use set() and "&=" to do set intersection operation.***


```python

```

## Question 88

>***With a given list [12,24,35,24,88,120,155,88,120,155], write a program to print this list after removing all duplicate values with original order reserved.***

----------------------
### Hints 
> ***Use set() to store a number of values without duplicate.***|

```python

```

## Question 89

>***Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a method "getGender" which can print "Male" for Male class and "Female" for Female class.***

```python

```

## Question 90

>***Please write a program which count and print the numbers of each character in a string input by console.***

>***Example:
If the following string is given as input to the program:***
```
abcdefgabc
```
>***Then, the output of the program should be:***
```
a,2
c,2
b,2
e,1
d,1
g,1
f,1
```
### Hints 
> ***Use dict to store key/value pairs.
Use dict.get() method to lookup a key with default value.***

```python

```
