# Python Exercise (61-70)

<!-- #region -->
# Question 61


>***The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:***
```
f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1
```
>***Please write a program to compute the value of f(n) with a given n input by console.***

>***Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:***
```
7
```
>***Then, the output of the program should be:***
```
13
```
>***In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.***

----------------------
### Hints 
> ***We can define recursive function in Python.***

```python

## Question 62

>***The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:***
```
f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1
```
>***Please write a program to compute the value of f(n) with a given n input by console.***

>***Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:***
```
7
```
>***Then, the output of the program should be:***
```
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13
```
>***In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.***

```python

```

## Question 63

>***Please write a program using generator to print the even numbers between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.***

>***Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:***
```
10
```
>***Then, the output of the program should be:***
```
0,2,4,6,8,10
```
>***In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.***

----------------------
### Hints 
> ***Use yield to produce the next value in generator.***

```python

```

## Question 64

>***Please write a program using generator to print the numbers which can be divisible by 5 and 7 between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.***

>***Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:***
```
100
```
>***Then, the output of the program should be:***
```
0,35,70
```
>***In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.***


```python

```

## Question 65
>***Please write assert statements to verify that every number in the list [2,4,6,8] is even.***



```python

```

## Question 66

>***Please write a program which accepts basic mathematic expression from console and print the evaluation result.***

>***Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:***
```
35 + 3
```
>***Then, the output of the program should be:***
```
38
```

```python

```

## Question 68

>***Please generate a random float where the value is between 10 and 100 using Python module.***


```python

```

## Question 69
>***Please generate a random float where the value is between 5 and 95 using Python module.***



```python

```

## Question 70

>***Please write a program to output a random even number between 0 and 10 inclusive using random module and list comprehension.***


```python

```
