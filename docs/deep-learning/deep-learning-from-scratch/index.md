# 🌍 DL4EO: Deep Learning from Scratch for Earth Observation

Welcome to **dl4eo** — a hands-on roadmap for learning and applying **Deep Learning in Geospatial and Earth Observation (EO) applications**.  
This repository is inspired by the idea of *“learning from scratch”* but tailored to the unique challenges of **satellite imagery, multispectral/hyperspectral data, and geospatial analysis**.  

---

## 📌 Goals
- Build deep learning models **from the ground up**, starting with the basics.  
- Apply models to **geospatial datasets**: crop health, land cover, object detection, segmentation, change detection, etc.  
- Provide **clean, reproducible code** with step-by-step progression.  
- Serve as both a **learning guide** and a **research playground**.
