    "\n",
    "A practical guide to geospatial tips, tricks, and workflows for remote sensing, GIS, and AI-powered Earth data analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Building the book\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to develop and/or build the GeoNext Handbook book, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone this repository\n",
    "2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)\n",
    "3. (Optional) Edit the books source files located in the `geonext-handbook/` directory\n",
    "4. Run `jupyter-book clean geonext-handbook/` to remove any existing builds\n",
    "5. Run `jupyter-book build geonext-handbook/`\n",
    "\n",
    "A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `geonext-handbook/_build/html/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hosting the book\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the [Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/publish/web.html) to discover options for deploying a book online using services such as GitHub, GitLab, or Netlify.\n",
    "\n",
    "For GitHub and GitLab deployment specifically, the [cookiecutter-jupyter-book](https://github.com/executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book) includes templates for, and information about, optional continuous integration (CI) workflow files to help easily and automatically deploy books online with GitHub or GitLab. For example, if you chose `github` for the `include_ci` cookiecutter option, your book template was created with a GitHub actions workflow file that, once pushed to GitHub, automatically renders and pushes your book to the `gh-pages` branch of your repo and hosts it on GitHub Pages when a push or pull request is made to the main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributors\n",
    "\n",
    "We welcome and recognize all contributions. You can see a list of current contributors in the [contributors tab](https://github.com/geonextgis/geonext-handbook/graphs/contributors).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Credits\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is created using the excellent open source [Jupyter Book project](https://jupyterbook.org/) and the [executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book template](https://github.com/executablebooks/cookiecutter-jupyter-book)."
